//
//For each of the following output examples: create a String variable that contains the desired output and print it out to the console, you can do this with only one String variable and one print statement for each output example.

//        We don't need no education
//        We don't need no thought control
        String sentOne = "We don't need no education \nWe dont need no thought control";
        System.out.println(sentOne);

//        Check "this" out!, "s inside of "s!
        String sentTwo = "Check \"this\" out!, \"s inside of \"s!";
        System.out.println(sentTwo);

//        In windows, the main drive is usually C:\
        String sentThree = "In windows, the main drive is usually C:\\";
        System.out.println(sentThree);

//        I can do backslashes \, double backslashes \\,
//        and the amazing triple backslash \\\!
        String sentFour = "I can do backslashes \\, double backslashes \\\\, \nand the amazing triple backslash \\\\\\!";
        System.out.println(sentFour);




//2. String Basics
// Create a class named Bob with a main method for the following exercise.
//
// Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
//
// Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question. (the input ends with a question mark)
// He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him. (the input ends with an exclamation mark)
// He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything. (empty input)
// He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
//
// Write the Java code necessary so that a user of your command line application can have a conversation with Bob.
